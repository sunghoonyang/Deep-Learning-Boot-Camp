### About
Tel-Aviv Deep Learning Bootcamp is an intensive (and free!) 5-day program intended to teach you all about deep learning. It is nonprofit focused on advancing data science education and fostering entrepreneurship. The Bootcamp is a prominent venue for graduate students, researchers, and data science professionals. It offers a chance to study the essential and innovative aspects of deep learning.	

Participation is via a donation to the A.L.S ASSOCIATION for promoting research of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease. 

### Curriculum
The Bootcamp amalgamates “Theory” and “Practice” – identifying that a deep learning scientist desires a survey of concepts combined with a strong application of practical techniques through labs. Primarily, the foundational material and tools of the Data Science practitioner are presented via Sk-Learn. Topics continue rapidly into exploratory data analysis and classical machine learning, where the data is organized, characterized, and manipulated. From day two, the students move from engineered models into 4 days of Deep Learning.
