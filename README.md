# Day 2 
### Intro
Modern high-performance GPUs such as NVIDIA GeForce GTX1080 provide 2560 computing
units, whereas in contrast, the contemporary CPU e.g., Intel i7-6900 contains only eight cores.
In this way, scientific computations such as image processing can be accelerated via a CPUâ€“GPU heterogeneous
platform in the following way: first, using the host CPU to perform sequential operations including
image input/output (I/O) and control operations; and second, using the GPU device to solve the
computational and memory-intensive problems.

### Requirements
- Ubuntu Linux 16.04
- Python 2.7 
- CUDA drivers.Running a CUDA container requires a machine with at least one CUDA-capable GPU and a driver compatible with the CUDA toolkit version you are using.
