# Intro
The compute unified device architecture (CUDA) is a heterogeneous sequential-parallel
programming model and software environment that allows for access to the NVIDIA’s GPU resources
via so-called kernels. Several programming languages including C/C++, Fortran, and Python are
supported for written kernels. 

Compared to the other non-scripting languages, Python emphasizes
quick development and offers a comprehensive mathematics library that has been widely adopted
by scientific communities.**PyCUDA involves using Python as a wrapper to the CUDA C
kernels, and features Python’s automatic memory management, error checking, and requires no
user-visible compilation, which makes it very suitable for interactive testing and quick prototyping in
our applications.**
